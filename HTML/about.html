        <p class="paragraph">
            The term 'passion fruit' in English comes from the passion flower, as an English translation of the Latin genus
            name, Passiflora, and may be spelled "passion fruit", "passionfruit", or "passion-fruit."[1][4] Around 1700, the
            name Passiflora was given by missionaries in Brazil as an educational aid to convert the indigenous inhabitants to
            Christianity: its name was flor das cinco chagas or "flower of the five wounds" to illustrate the crucifixion of
            Christ and his resurrection,[5] with other plant components also named after an emblem in the Passion of Jesus.
